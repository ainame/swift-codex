# Upstream Reference

This repository ports the OpenAI Codex SDK work in [`openai/codex`](https://github.com/openai/codex), while the current transport and protocol behavior are reviewed primarily against the vendored Python app-server client and the v2 app-server schema.

## Recorded Upstream Basis

- Upstream repository: `openai/codex`
- Vendored upstream checkout: `vendor/openai-codex`
- Vendored upstream commit: `527244910fb851cea6147334dbc08f8fbce4cb9d`
- Reviewed JSON-RPC basis commit SHA: `527244910fb851cea6147334dbc08f8fbce4cb9d`
- Reviewed JSON-RPC basis commit URL: `https://github.com/openai/codex/commit/527244910fb851cea6147334dbc08f8fbce4cb9d`
- Last reviewed date: `2026-03-24`

The vendored submodule commit above identifies which upstream checkout is bundled in this repository. The current Swift runtime transport now follows the vendored Python `codex_app_server` client and v2 app-server protocol, not the older `exec` transport.

## How To Keep This In Sync

When porting new behavior from upstream or validating parity:

1. Identify the exact `openai/codex` commit used as the basis.
2. Review the relevant files from the vendored checkout in `vendor/openai-codex`.
3. Update this file with:
   - the exact commit SHA
   - a GitHub commit URL
   - the review date
   - the specific upstream files or features reviewed
   - any intentional Swift-specific deviations
4. Update [`README.md`](README.md) if the public status or supported behavior changed.
5. Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) with user-visible changes.
6. Update [`NOTICE`](NOTICE) only if attribution requirements change or additional derived material is imported.

### Unreleased

- Vendored checkout: `vendor/openai-codex` at `527244910fb851cea6147334dbc08f8fbce4cb9d`
- Reviewed upstream files:
  - `sdk/python/src/codex_app_server/api.py`

  - `codex-rs/app-server-protocol/schema/json/codex_app_server_protocol.v2.schemas.json`
- Reviewed upstream features:
  - initialize, thread, turn, model, and notification method shapes
  - typed response payloads and notification payload mapping
  - default approval behavior for known approval requests
  - empty-object responses for interrupt/archive/name/compact style methods
  - `data` collection fields on thread/model list responses
  - server metadata normalization from initialize payloads
- Intentional Swift-specific deviations:
  - the repository still follows Swift API conventions and async/await rather than Python synchronous wrappers
  - `JSONValue.number(Double)` remains the raw escape hatch type, while generated typed models use integer fields where the schema requires them
  - the SDK keeps explicit `Codex`, `CodexThread`, and `CodexTurnHandle` handle types separate from protocol record types like `Thread` and `Turn`
  - the Swift package still exists as a porting project derived from the broader `openai/codex` SDK work, but runtime semantics now come from the JSON-RPC app-server basis above
